# Part 4: Robust Run Node in Pi Background Systemd (in-work)

## Run on Reboot & in the Background
With Tmux you still have some manual set and stop work to do.

Tmux is really a temporary solution. The robust and reliable way would be to run the node upon pi startup, reboot, and automatically run as a systemd service in the background. Set and forget. 

Follow these readme setps once again from [Chris (Eeysirhc)](https://github.com/Eeysirhc)

In terminal `htop` to see the systemd services (and more).

Enjoy.
