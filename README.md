# Tutorial: Running an Ergo Full Node on a Raspberry Pi

A tutorial on how to setup and run an Ergo Full Node on a Headless Raspberry Pi.

A headless raspberry pi (pi, raspi, or raspberrypi) does not have a monitor or mouse plugged in. Instead, you are securely remoted into the pi via the terminal command line.

This is geared toward beginners who want to learn and hopefully get more Ergo nodes running! See [ErgoNodes.net](http://ergonodes.net/).

Don't worry, it's not that hard, and you will feel super cool afterwards.

The tutorial includes:

- Hardware Shopping List
- Brief Intro to Headless Command Line Interface (CLI)

- Secure Shelling into the Pi
- Setup External Storage USB

## Configure, Download, and Run the Ergo Node

[Part 2: Ergo Full Node Steps](/part2-ergo-full-node.md) 
- Setup & Configure the Pi for Ergo Node
- Headless Ergo Node setup
    - goal is for nipopow bootstrap setup
- Run the node in the background thru a tmux session
